Voice cloning technology poses significant privacy threats by enabling unauthorized speech synthesis from limited audio samples. Existing defenses based on imperceptible adversarial perturbations are vulnerable to common audio preprocessing such as denoising and compression. We propose SceneGuard, a training-time voice protection method that applies scene-consistent audible background noise to speech recordings. Unlike imperceptible perturbations, SceneGuard leverages naturally occurring acoustic scenes (e.g., airport, street, park) to create protective noise that is contextually appropriate and robust to countermeasures. We evaluate SceneGuard on text-to-speech training attacks using 100 training and 40 test samples, demonstrating 5.5\% speaker similarity degradation with extremely high statistical significance ($p < 10^{-15}$, Cohen's $d = 2.18$) while preserving 98.6\% speech intelligibility (STOI = 0.986). Robustness evaluation shows that SceneGuard maintains or enhances protection under five common countermeasures including MP3 compression, spectral subtraction, lowpass filtering, and downsampling. Our results suggest that audible, scene-consistent noise provides a more robust alternative to imperceptible perturbations for training-time voice protection.
